## item_proto_lib

**item_proto_lib** is a free open-source library used to edit _Metin2_'s client item database.
It should be safe to use, yet it is recommended to have a backup of your files before using it, just in case.

This library provides only the basic functionality for editing. It does not include any visual interface. I will provide a free visual interface, including precompiled library.

You can download the free interface from [MEGA](https://mega.nz/#!uc4SmKIC!rAODgCsd_OzzJyAjgK3xiCW_LGxAQrElQgw4Lu2-x98). I can also provide you with visual interface source code, if requested.

### Editing
#### What you need
- Microsoft Visual Studio 2015
- C++/CLI extension for VS

#### How to
Just clone or download the repository and open _item_proto_lib.sln_. You should be able to edit any file you want. It contains some documention in code, but the code itself should be understandable.

## Building
Since the library has no external dependencies, you can build it immediately after download using the above stated dependencies.

## Usage
The library is CLI so it should be used in any visual programming language, like: _C#_ or _Visual Basic_. Just create a new _Windows Forms_ or _WPF_ application, open _Solution Explorer_, right click on _References_ and add the library.
Keep in  mind that everything is inside **item_proto_lib** namespace.

## Contribution
Anyone can contribute to the project, but you **must** follow my coding style.
